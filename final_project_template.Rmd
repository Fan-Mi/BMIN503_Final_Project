### Overview
My project is to analyze the effectiveness of COVID vaccination in Philadelphia area. I will analyze the trends of hospitalizations, infectionos, and deaths along the time people choose to get vaccinated. I will take a deeper look at different age groups, races, and census tracks (zip code).

The data I am using are:
vaccine data: https://www.phila.gov/programs/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19/data/vaccine/
covid result data: https://www.phila.gov/programs/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19/data/testing/


The three mentees for my projects are:
-Helen Shi
-Ruiz Victor
-Sifei Han

My mentees suggested me on the topics and research questions that can be answered by the data.

### Introduction 
While most people believe Covid vaccination can help beat the pandemic, still there are people who do not. This project aims to use data-driven approach, combined with statistical and spatial analysis, to assess the effectiveness of Covid vaccination in Philadelphia county area. The result may help people understand more about the vaccination and may potentially earn more trust on it if results are positive. It may also identify specific demographic groups that the vaccines do not protect well and I will try to research the potential causes with confounding factors being taken into consideration. I will also build machine learning models to predict daily infected people using vaccination data, people demographics, and spatial-socioeconomic features. To solve the problem, knowlege of statistics, spacial analysis, and machine learning will be combined and used.

### Methods
Describe the data used and general methodological approach. Subsequently, incorporate full R code necessary to retrieve and clean data, and perform analysis. Be sure to include a description of code so that others (including your future self) can understand what you are doing and why. 


### Results
Describe your results and include relevant tables, plots, and code/comments used to obtain them. End with a brief conclusion of your findings related to the question you set out to address. You can include references if you'd like, but this is not required.
